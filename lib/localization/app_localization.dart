/// The [AppLocalizations] class provides localization support for the application,
/// allowing it to display content in different languages based on the user's locale.
///
/// It loads localized strings from JSON files located in the `lib/constant/language/`
/// directory, with each file named according to the language code (e.g., `en.json`).
/// The class offers methods to retrieve localized strings and integrates with Flutter's
/// localization system via a delegate.
///
/// Usage:
/// - Include [AppLocalizations.delegate] in the `localizationsDelegates` list of your app.
/// - Access localized strings using `AppLocalizations.of(context)?.translate('key')`.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)?.translate('hello') ?? 'hello')
/// ```
/// The [_AppLocalizationsDelegate] class is a custom [LocalizationsDelegate] for
/// [AppLocalizations]. It determines supported locales, loads localized resources,
/// and manages reload behavior for localization changes.
///
/// This delegate should be added to the app's `localizationsDelegates` to enable
/// localization support.
